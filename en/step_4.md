## The pushrod mechanism

You're going to use the servo and a paperclip to make a pushrod that will open and close the cardboard flap mouth of your robot head.

--- task ---

Get a paperclip and unbend it so that you have a 180° loop at one end and a 90° bend at the other.

Your servo should rotate from horizontal to horizontal on each side.
