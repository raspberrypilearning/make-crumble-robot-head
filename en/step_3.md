## Preparing the servo

Let's have a look at the servo and some very important preparation before we use it in the project.

Servos have detachable plastic arms that can be fixed to the rotating shaft. These arms are called 'horns'. They come in a variety of shapes for different uses. Most servos come with a small bag of different horns.

Select the horn that has a single long arm. If there are no single arm horns then you will need to adapt another horn by cutting off any additional arms.

Place the horn on rotating shaft.

Test the range of the servo by moving the horn gently as far as it willgo in each direction. Don't force it.

When the servo is lying flat on its side,you want the horn to rotate freely from near the bottom surface right round to the other side.

If you are very lucky, you'll get this right first time, but if not, simply adjust it:

+ Rotate the horn to its full extent in one direction
+ Remove the horn from the rotating shaft
+ Replace the horn to the position that you want it to be at full rotation in that direction

Place the servo on its side and check that you did this right by checking its full rotation points again

As well as a selection of horns, servos also come with screws to fix the horns in place to prevent them working loose and falling off when the servo rotates.

Once the horn is exactly where you want it, screw it in place to fix it.

Note: Once the servo becomes fixed inside your project, it is very hard to get to this fixing screw.
