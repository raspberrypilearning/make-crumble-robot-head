## Introduction

You will use your coding, making, and engineering skills to create a robot head with a moving mouth, using a servo and a pushrod mechanism. 

Watch you fingers. It bites!

### What you will make

You will make a robot head from cardboard and use a servo with a bent paper clip as a pushrod to open and close the mouth controlled by your code.

### Hardware

+ A PC, Mac or Chromebook with Crumble software installed and a USB port

+ A Crumble controller
+ A 3xAA battery pack
+ Crocodile leads

+ A small 180Â° position servo, such as an SG90 or SG92R
+ A Crumbliser OR jumper leads

+ Materials to make your robot head, e.g. a small box or cardboard
+ A paperclip
+ Tools to make your robot head, e.g. glue or tape, and scissors

Note: A hot melt glue gun makes fixing the servo into your project very easy.
