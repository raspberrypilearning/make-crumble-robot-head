## Introduction

Use your coding, making, and engineering skills to create a robot head with a moving mouth, using a servo and a pushrod mechanism. 

Watch you fingers &mdash; it bites!

### What you will make

+ A robot head out of cardbord 
+ A pushrod from a servo and a bent paper clip (this will open and close the mouth) 
+ Write code to control the mouth's movement

### Hardware

+ A PC, Mac, or Chromebook with Crumble software installed and a USB port

+ A Crumble controller
+ A 3xAA battery pack
+ Crocodile clip cables

+ A small 180Â° position servo, such as an SG90 or SG92R
+ A Crumbliser OR jumper leads

+ Materials to make your robot head, e.g. a small box or cardboard
+ A paper clip
+ Tools to make your robot head, e.g. scissors and glue or tape

**Note**: A hot melt glue gun is an easy tool to fix the servo into your project.
