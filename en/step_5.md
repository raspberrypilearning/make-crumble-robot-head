Connect your Crumble board to a computer using a micro USB cable, and to a battery pack using crocodile clip cables.

To connect the servo to your Crumbliser, you can use either [Crumblisers](https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/product/crumbliser-pack-of-5/){:target="_blank"} or male-to-male jumper cables.

If you have Crumblisers available then this is by far the easiest way to connect your servo and Crumble together.
