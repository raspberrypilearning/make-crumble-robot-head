## The robot head

The first step is to make your robot head. You can use a small cardboard box or make a box shape from flat cardboard, using a 3D shape net.

Making a 3D net from scratch is great, but it can be time-consuming. There is no right or wrong method to make your robot head. If you want to focus on the mechanism and coding, small boxes are very cheap to buy from online retailers.

This example project uses a six inch wide cube box.

Take your box, decide where the face will be and mark the two side flaps to be cut off.

Cut the two side flaps off, using a knife or scissors.

Tape or glue the top flap down to be the face above the mouth.

Closing the back opening of the box helps it keep its shape at this point. However, for most people, having it open makes the rest the build easier.

Make eyes for your robot head. You can draw or paint eyes straight on or use cut up card, paper, or anything you like. After all, it's your robot head!
